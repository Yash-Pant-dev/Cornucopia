# Note on the Server
Server refers to the API Server which serves the data as requested by the app.
Most of the routing is handled by the next-router itself.

# Each schema should have a version for easier backwards compatibility

# Database
The app uses Redis as a caching layer and mongo-db as the storage for all the documents.
